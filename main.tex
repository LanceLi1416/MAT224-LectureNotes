\subsection{Course Structure}

\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{Pictures/Course Structure.png}
\end{center}

Our course has multiple components. Each component is built carefully to support several aspects of the learning outcomes of our course as listed in the syllabus. This page explains how different components of the course interact with one another and helps you navigate the course

\subsubsection{Reading Quizzes}

A typical week in our course starts by doing the reading assigned for that week and ends by revisiting the reading assignment for that week.  Assigned readings are mainly from our primary textbook \cite{texbook} followed by a Quercus quiz on your assigned readings for the week and that of the previous week.  You should start your reading as soon as they are posted.

You should read all the assigned readings for the week and submit your quiz on Quercus. {\color{red}The weekly quiz is due at 10 am every Monday.} The best strategy is to spread out the reading throughout the week. You are not expected to understand everything when you read the textbook before the class. Your learning will happen gradually during lectures, tutorials, and mostly when you do the suggested problems from the textbook and the written homework.  You will need to review the textbook again after lectures. Reading Quizzes quizzes makeup 5\% of your final grade.

\subsubsection{Lectures}

\textbf{What to expect from lectures?}

 During lectures, your instructor will guide you through important concepts and invite you to participate in lecture activities. Lectures complement your reading, tutorials, and homework. Lectures are not meant to replace textbook reading. There will be concepts and theorems that are only discussed in the textbook or only during your lectures, or only in homework. You are encouraged to attend all lectures. While in your lecture you are expected to actively participate in all activities prompted by your instructor. While the delivery of the course is online, your instructor may record the lectures and make it available for you to watch asynchronously. Note that watching the lectures do not replace attending them as you will miss the in-class activities. You are asked to do a lecture reflection quiz at the end of your lecture week. The reflection due date is a day after your last lecture of the week. Reflections are a tool for your instructor to emphasize important concepts in the lectures and to collect feedback from you, and an opportunity for you to reflect on your understanding of the lecture material. Reflections are part of your participation grade as per our syllabus.

\subsubsection{Tutorials}

You must be enrolled in a tutorial.  You will have weekly tutorial sessions starting on Jan 24th. During tutorials, you will work with your classmates in small groups on tutorial worksheets.  Tutorial worksheets are carefully designed to be discussed in groups. Tutorial worksheets are roughly one week behind the lectures.

Ideally, you want to read, understand, and think about all the questions before your tutorial. This involves checking all the definitions and statements of the results you need to know to tackle questions.  Set aside 15 minutes before your tutorial to go over questions. Your tutorial sessions are facilitated by your TAs. During your tutorial, your TA will ask you to sit with your tutorial group. You will work with your groupmates on selected problems from the worksheet. Each group works on a shared document that will be checked by the TA during the tutorial. Do not expect your TA to work out the questions for you or to teach the concepts.  Your TA will give you feedback on what you already put down in your shared document. That is the more you work among your group the more your TA can help you. Your TA might choose to go over some of the questions for the entire class or answer your questions within your groups. You get the most out of your tutorials if you work on the problems ahead of time and stay active and engaged throughout the tutorial. After all, you can only get an answer to those questions you ask, either from your peers or the TA.  You will get solutions to all tutorial questions at the end of the tutorial week. Tutorials are one of the most important components of the course because they facilitate your communication with your peers.  Explain concepts to your group mates and ask them to do the same for you.  At the end of each tutorial, you will submit your shared document as a group.

This submission is marked holistically, and not for correctness. You and all your group members will receive the same mark. Your active participation in your tutorial is measured by your group submission marks. Your active participation in tutorials is part of your participation grade.

\subsubsection{Homework}
You will have four types of homework. We already talked about two of them. That is reading assignments, due weekly, as part of your Reading Quiz, and Tutorial worksheets that you work on with help of your peers during your tutorial and submit with your group.  The other two are

\itblue{WeBWork.} WeBWork is an online assignment system. You have weekly WeBWork due every Wednesday 11:59 pm.  These questions are straightforward and cover what you learned in the same week and the past week. To access the homework, you should follow the link in the assignment posted under the Homework module. You will be automatically be directed to WeBWork environment. {\color{red}WARNING:} You should check your grade for WeBWork inside the WebWork environment and not in Quercus. You may occasionally see some grades regarding this homework appear on Quercus. Those numbers are not accurate and will disappear! WeBWork makes 5\% of your final grade.

\itblue{Written Homework.}  There will be five written homework sets. These homework sets are rather long and you have about two weeks to do them. You should submit these homework sets individually. You will receive instructions on how to submit your written homework.  Only selected questions from each set are graded. The lowest grade will be dropped. Written homework sets make 10\% of your final grade.

\subsection{Lecture Rules}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Come prepared (read the textbook)
    \item Be fully present
    \begin{itemize}
        \item No distraction
        \item Ready to engage
        \item Ready to participate in activities
    \end{itemize}
    \item Reflect
    \begin{itemize}
        \item What did you learn?
        \item Engage with the textbook
        \item Write down your questions
        \item Follow up on piazza
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Fields, Complex Numbers and Vector Spaces}

\section{Fields and Complex Numbers}

\subsection{Fields}

\setcounter{chapter}{5}
\setcounter{definitionT}{3}
\begin{definition}[Field]\index{Field}\index{Addition}\index{Sum}\index{Multiplication}\index{Product}
    A \term{field} is a set\footnote{Note that such set must be \bred{non-empty}.} $\mathbb{F}$ with two operations, defined on ordered pairs of elements of $\mathbb{F}$, called \term{addition} and \term{multiplication}. Addition assigns to the pair $x$ and $y \in \mathbb{F}$ their \term{sum}, which is denoted by $x + y$ and multiplication assigns to the pair $x$ and $y$ their \term{product}, which is denoted by $x \cdot y$ or $xy$. These two operations must satisfy the following properties for all $x$, $y$ and $z \in \mathbb{F}$:

    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
        \item Commutativity of addition $x + y = y + z$.

        \item Associativity of addition: $(x + y) + z = x + (y + z)$.

        \item Existence of an additive identity: There is an element $0 \in \mathbb{F}$, called zero, such that $x + 0 = a$.

        \item Existence of additive inverses: For each $x$ there is an element $-x \in \mathbb{F}$ such that $x + (-x) = 0$.

        \item Commutativity of multiplication: $xy  = yx$.

        \item Associativity of multiplication: $(xy)z = x(yz)$.

        \item Distributivity: $(x + y)z = xz + yz$ and $x(y + z) = xy + xz$.

        \item Existence of a multiplicative identity: There is an element $1 \in \mathbb{F}$, called $1$, such that $x \cdot 1  = x$.

        \item Existence of multiplicative inverses: If $x \neq 0$, then there is an element $x^{-1} \in \mathbb{F}$ such that $x \cdot x^{-1}  = 1$.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}
\setcounter{chapter}{1}

\subsection{Complex Numbers}

Goal: build a field containing $\mathbb{R}$ such that all polynomials (such as $x^2 + 1$) have their roots.

\setcounter{chapter}{5}
\setcounter{section}{1}
\setcounter{definitionT}{1}
\begin{definition}\index{Complex Numbers}
    The set of \term{complex numbers}, denoted $\mathbb{C}$, is the set of ordered pairs of real numbers$ (a, b)$ with the operations of addition and multiplication defined by

    {~~~}

    For all $(a, b)$ and $(c, d) \in \mathbb{C}$, the \term{sum} of $(a, b)$ and $(c, d)$ is the complex number defined by $(a, b) + (c, d) = (a + c, b + d)$

    {~~~}

    and the \term{product} of $(a, b)$ and $(c, d)$ is the complex number defined by $(a, b)(c, d) = (ac - bd, ad + cb)$
\end{definition}
\setcounter{section}{2}
\setcounter{chapter}{1}

The subset of $\mathbb{C}$ consisting of those elements with second coordinate zero, $\{ (a, 0) | a \in \mathbb{R} \}$, will be identified with the real numbers in the obvious way, $a \in \mathbb{R}$ is identified with $(a, 0) \in \mathbb{C}$. If we apply our rules of addition and multiplication to the subset $\mathbb{R} \subset \mathbb{C}$, we obtain
$$(a, 0) + (c, 0) = (a + c, 0)$$
and
$$(a, 0)(c, 0) = (ac - 0 \cdot 0)(a \cdot 0 + c \cdot 0) = (ac, 0)$$

\setcounter{chapter}{5}
\setcounter{section}{1}
\setcounter{dummy}{4}
\begin{proposition}
The set of complex numbers is a field with the operations of addition and scalar multiplication as defined previously.
\end{proposition}
\setcounter{section}{2}
\setcounter{chapter}{1}

\begin{proof}
    WTS $\mathbb{C}$ is a field\footnote{To show $\mathbb{F}$ is a field, we need to check commutativity, associativity, existence of additive identity and additive inverse, multiplicative identity and multiplicative inverse, and the distributivity between addition and multiplication. }.

    (i), (ii), (v), (vi), and (vii) follow immediately.

    {~~~}

    \textbf{(iii)} The additive identity is $0 = 0 + 0i$ since

    $(0 + 0i) + (a + bi) = (0 + a) + (0 + b)i = a + bi$

    {~~~}

    \textbf{(iv)} The additive inverse of $a + bi$ is $(-a) + (-b)i$.

    $(a + bi) + ((-a) + (-b)i) = (a + (-a)) + (b + (-b))i = 0 + 0i = 0$.

    {~~~}

    \textbf{(viii)} The multiplicative identity is $1 = 1 + 0 \cdot i$ since

    $(1 + 0 \cdot i)(a + bi) = (1 \cdot a - 0 \cdot b) + (1 \cdot b + 0 \cdot a)i = a + bi$.

    {~~~}

    \textbf{(ix)} Note first that if $a + bi \neq 0$, then either $a \neq 0$ or $b \neq 0$ and $a^2 + b^2 \neq 0$. Further, note that $(a + bi)(a + (-b)i) = a^2 + b^2$.

    Therefore $\displaystyle (a + bi) \frac{a - ib}{a^2 + b^2} = 1$.

    Thus, $(a + ib)^{-1} = (a - ib) / (a^2 + b^2)$.
\end{proof}

\begin{exercise}
    Compute the following.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $(3-5i)^{-1}$
        {\color{lightblue} \begin{align*}
            (3-5i)^{-1}
            &=\frac{(3+5i)}{3^2+5^2}
            \\
            &=\frac{3}{34}+\frac{5}{34}i
        \end{align*} }

        \item $\displaystyle \frac{4-2i}{3-5i} = (4-2i)(3-5i)^{-1}$
        {\color{lightblue} \begin{align*}
            \frac{4-2i}{3-5i}
            &= (4-2i)(3-5i)^{-1}
            \\
            &=(4-2i) \left( \frac{1}{34}(3+5i) \right)
            \\
            &=\frac{1}{34}(4-2i)(3+5i)
            \\
            &=\frac{1}{34}(12+10+20i-6i)
            \\
            &=\frac{1}{34}(22+14i)
        \end{align*} }
    \end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}

\begin{example}
    Let $\mathbb{F}_2 = \{ 0, 1 \}$.

    \begin{center}
        \begin{tabular}{c | c c}
            \toprule
            + &0 &0 \\
            \midrule
            0 &0 &1 \\
            1 &1 &0 \\
            \bottomrule
        \end{tabular}
        \hspace{0.25\linewidth}
        \begin{tabular}{c | c c}
            \toprule
            $\times$ &0 &0 \\
            \midrule
            0 &0 &0 \\
            1 &0 &1 \\
            \bottomrule
        \end{tabular}
    \end{center}

    \textbf{Discussion}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Is $+$ commutative? How to see it visually?

        \begin{itemize}
            \item Yes.

            \item The diagonals align up (this tabel is symmetric).
        \end{itemize}

        \item Is $\times$ commutatiove? How to see it visually?

        \begin{itemize}
            \item Yes.

            \item The diagonals align up (this tabel is symmetric).
        \end{itemize}

        \item Does $(\mathbb{F}_2, +, \times)$ have additive and multiplicative identities? How to see them visually?

        \begin{itemize}
            \item Yes, they all have their identities.

            \item $0$ is the additive identity.

            The corresponding rows and columns of $0$ are copies of the index row/column.

            \item $1$ is the multiplicative identity.

            The corresponding rows and columns of $1$ are copies of the index row/column.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{example}

\section{Vector Spaces}

\subsection{Vector Space}

Let $\mathbb{F}$ be a field\footnote{The differences between a field and a vector space: \begin{itemize} \item Over \term{fields}, we have two binary operations; \item Over \term{vector spaces}, we have one binary operation and one scalar multiplication. \end{itemize}}.

\setcounter{chapter}{5}
\setcounter{section}{2}
\begin{definition}[Vector Space over a Field]\index{Vector Space over a Field}
    A \term{vector space over $\mathbb{F}$} is a set $V$ (whose elements are called \term{vectors}) together with two operations:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A binary operation called \bred{vector addition}, which for each pair of vectors $\overrightarrow{v}, \overrightarrow{w} \in V$ produces a vector denoted $\overrightarrow{v} + \overrightarrow{w} \in V$, and

        \item an operation called \bred{multiplication by a scalar}\footnote{This is also called a \bred{scalar multiplication}} (a field element), which for each vector $\overrightarrow{v} \in V$, and each scalar $c \in \mathbb{F}$ produces a vector denoted $c\overrightarrow{v}\in V$.
    \end{itemize}
\end{definition}
\setcounter{section}{3}
\setcounter{chapter}{1}

\begin{minipage}[t]{0.45\linewidth}
    $$\begin{matrix} &+: &V\times V  &\to &V \\& &(\overrightarrow{v},\overrightarrow{w}) &\mapsto &\overrightarrow{v}+\overrightarrow{w} \end{matrix}$$
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.45\linewidth}
    $$\begin{matrix} &\times: &\mathbb{F}\times V  &\to &V \\& &(c,\overrightarrow{v}) &\mapsto &c\overrightarrow{v} \end{matrix}$$
\end{minipage}

Furthermore, the two operations must satisfy the following axioms:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\arabic*)]
    \item For all vectors $\overrightarrow{u}$, $\overrightarrow{v}$, and $\overrightarrow{w} \in V$, $(\overrightarrow{u} + \overrightarrow{v}) + \overrightarrow{w} = \overrightarrow{u} + (\overrightarrow{v} + \overrightarrow{w})$. (addition is \term{associative})

    \item For all vectors $\overrightarrow{v}$ and $\overrightarrow{w} \in V$, $\overrightarrow{v} + \overrightarrow{w} = \overrightarrow{w} + \overrightarrow{v}$. (addition is \term{commutative})

    \item There exists a vector $\overrightarrow{0} \in V$ with the property that $\overrightarrow{v} + \overrightarrow{0} = \overrightarrow{v}$ for all vectors $\overrightarrow{v} \in V$. ($\exists$ an \term{additive identity})

    \item For each vector $\overrightarrow{v} \in V$, there exists a vector denoted $-\overrightarrow{v}$ with the property that $\overrightarrow{v} + -\overrightarrow{v} = \overrightarrow{0}$. ($\exists$ \term{additive inverse})

    \item For all vectors $\overrightarrow{v}$ and $\overrightarrow{w} \in V$  and all scalars $c \in \mathbb{F}$, $c(\overrightarrow{v}+ \overrightarrow{w}) = c\overrightarrow{v} + c\overrightarrow{w}$. (\term{distributive} property 1)

    \item For all vectors $\overrightarrow{v} \in V$, and all scalars $c$ and $d \in \mathbb{F}$, $(c + d)\overrightarrow{v} = c\overrightarrow{v} + d\overrightarrow{v}$. (\term{distributive} property 2)

    \item For all vectors $\overrightarrow{v} \in V$, and all scalars $c$ and $d \in \mathbb{F}$, $(cd)\overrightarrow{v} = c(d\overrightarrow{v})$. (multiplication is \term{associative})

    \item For all vectors $\overrightarrow{v} \in V$, $1\overrightarrow{v} = \overrightarrow{v}$. ($\exists$ an \term{multiplicative identity})
\end{enumerate}

\begin{example}
{~~~}

    Define $\mathbb{R}^n = \left\{ \begin{pmatrix} a_1\\\vdots\\a_n \end{pmatrix}, a_i \in \mathbb{R} \right\}$, 
    $\mathbb{C}^n = \left\{ \begin{pmatrix} z_1\\\vdots\\z_n \end{pmatrix}, a_i \in \mathbb{C} \right\}$. 
    
    Take $\overrightarrow{z} = \begin{pmatrix} z_1 \\ \vdots \\ z_n \end{pmatrix}$, $\overrightarrow{w} = \begin{pmatrix} w_1 \\ \vdots \\ w_n \end{pmatrix}$, then $\overrightarrow{z} + \overrightarrow{w} = \begin{pmatrix} z_1 + w_1 \\ \vdots \\ z_n + w_n \end{pmatrix}$\footnote{Note that the two $+$'s ($\overrightarrow{z} + \overrightarrow{w}$ and $z_i + w_i$) here are different. The former is vector addition, while the later is addition over $\mathbb{C}$. }.
    
    In general, $\mathbb{F}^n := \left\{ \begin{pmatrix} a_1 \\ \vdots \\ a_n \end{pmatrix}, a_i \in \mathbb{F} \right\}$ is a vector space over the field $\mathbb{F}$~\footnote{``A vector space over the field $\mathbb{F}$'' can be shortened to ``$\mathbb{F}$ vector space'', or ``$\mathbb{F}$\_V.S.''. }. 
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Additive identity: $\overrightarrow{0} := \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ \vdots \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}$\footnote{Note that $\overrightarrow{0}$ is the additive identity of $\mathbb{F}^n$, while the $0$’s are the additive identity over the field $\mathbb{F}$.}

        \item Take $\overrightarrow{v} = \begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\ \vdots \\ v_n \end{pmatrix} \in \mathbb{F}^n$, then $-\overrightarrow{v} = \begin{pmatrix} -v_1 \\ \vdots \\ -v_n \end{pmatrix}$~\footnote{Note that the two $-$'s ($-\overrightarrow{v}$ and $-v_i$) here are different. The former is the symbol for the additive inverse inside $\mathbb{F}^n$, while the later is additive inverse over the field $\mathbb{F}$. }. 
    \end{itemize}
\end{example}

\begin{example}
{~~~}

    Define $\mathcal{P}_n(\mathbb{F}) = \left\{ a_0 + a_1x + a_2x^2 + \dots + a_nx^n ~|~a_i \in \mathbb{F} \right\}$. 
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\mathcal{P}_n(\mathbb{F})$ is an $\mathbb{F}$\_V.S. 
        
        Take $p(x) = a_0 + a_1x + \dots + a_nx^n$, $q(x)=b_0 + b_1x + \dots + b_nx^n \in P_n(\mathbb{F})$. 
        
        $p(x)+q(x):=(a_0+b_0)+(a_1+b_1)x+\dots+(a_nb_n)x^n$. 
        
        $cp(x) := ca_0 + \overbrace{ca_1}^{c ~\times~ a_1 \mathrm{~on~}\mathbb{F}}x + \dots + ca_nx^n$. 
    \end{itemize}
\end{example}

\begin{example}
{~~~}

\begin{proposition}
    Let $V$ be a vector space. Then 
    
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
        \item The zero vector $\overrightarrow{0}$ (additive identity in $V$) is unique.
        \begin{proof}
            WTS Additive identity in $V$ is unique\footnote{To prove that something is unique, a common technique is to assume we have two examples of the object in question, then show that those two examples must in fact be equal. }.

            Suppose $\overrightarrow{0}$ and $\overrightarrow{0}'$ are additive identity in $V$. 
            
            Since $\overrightarrow{0}$ is additive identity, $\forall \overrightarrow{v} \in V$, $\overrightarrow{v} + \overrightarrow{0} = \overrightarrow{v}$. In particular, $\overrightarrow{0}' + \overrightarrow{0} = \overrightarrow{0}'$. 
            
            Since $\overrightarrow{0'}$ is additive identity, $\forall \overrightarrow{v} \in V$, $\overrightarrow{v} + \overrightarrow{0}' = \overrightarrow{v}$. In particular, $\overrightarrow{0} + \overrightarrow{0}' = \overrightarrow{0}$. 

            So $\overrightarrow{0'} = \overrightarrow{0} + \overrightarrow{0}' = \overrightarrow{0}$, so there is only one additive identity in $V$.
        \end{proof}

        \item For all $\overrightarrow{v} \in V$ , $\underset{\mathbb{F}}{0}\overrightarrow{v} = \overrightarrow{0_V}$.

        \begin{proof}
            WTS $\forall \overrightarrow{v} \in V$, $\underset{\mathbb{F}}{0}\overrightarrow{v} = \overrightarrow{0_V}$. 
            
            Pick $\overrightarrow{v} \in V$. 
            \begin{align*}
                \underset{\mathbb{F}}{0}\overrightarrow{v} 
                &= (\underset{\mathbb{F}}{0} + \underset{\mathbb{F}}{0})\overrightarrow{v} 
                \\
                &= \underset{\mathbb{F}}{0}\overrightarrow{v} + \underset{\mathbb{F}}{0}\overrightarrow{v}
                \\
                (-\underset{\mathbb{F}}{0}\overrightarrow{v}) + \underset{\mathbb{F}}{0}\overrightarrow{v}
                &= (-\underset{\mathbb{F}}{0}\overrightarrow{v}) + (\underset{\mathbb{F}}{0}\overrightarrow{v} + \underset{\mathbb{F}}{0}\overrightarrow{v})
                \\
                -\underset{\mathbb{F}}{0}\overrightarrow{v} + \underset{\mathbb{F}}{0}\overrightarrow{v}
                &= (-\underset{\mathbb{F}}{0}\overrightarrow{v} + \underset{\mathbb{F}}{0}\overrightarrow{v}) + \underset{\mathbb{F}}{0}\overrightarrow{v}
                \\
                \overrightarrow{0_V}
                &=
                \overrightarrow{0_V} + \underset{\mathbb{F}}{0}\overrightarrow{v}
                \\
                &=\underset{\mathbb{F}}{0}\overrightarrow{v}
            \end{align*}
            
            Thus, $\forall \overrightarrow{v} \in V$, $\underset{\mathbb{F}}{0}\overrightarrow{v} = \overrightarrow{0_V}$. 
        \end{proof}

        \item For each $\overrightarrow{v} \in V$, the additive inverse $-\overrightarrow{v}$ is unique.

        \begin{proof}
            We use the same idea as in the proof of part a. Given $\overrightarrow{v} \in V$, if $-\overrightarrow{v}$ and $(-\overrightarrow{v})'$ are two additive inverses of $\overrightarrow{v}$, then on one hand we have $\overrightarrow{v} + -\overrightarrow{v}  + (-\overrightarrow{v})' = (\overrightarrow{v} + -\overrightarrow{v}) + (-\overrightarrow{v})' = \overrightarrow{0} + (-\overrightarrow{v})' = (-\overrightarrow{v})'$, by axioms 1, 4, and 3. On the other hand, if we use axiom 2 first before associating, we have $\overrightarrow{v} + -\overrightarrow{v}  + (-\overrightarrow{v})' = \overrightarrow{v} + (-\overrightarrow{v})' + -\overrightarrow{v} = (\overrightarrow{v} + (-\overrightarrow{v})') + -\overrightarrow{v} = \overrightarrow{0} + -\overrightarrow{v} = -\overrightarrow{v}$. Hence $-\overrightarrow{v} = (-\overrightarrow{v})'$, and the additive inverse of $\overrightarrow{v}$ is unique.
        \end{proof}
        
        \item For all $\overrightarrow{v} \in V$, and all $c \in \mathbb{R}$, $(-c)\overrightarrow{v}  = -(c\overrightarrow{v})$.
        \begin{proof}
            We have $c\overrightarrow{v} + (-c)\overrightarrow{v} = (c + -c)\overrightarrow{v} = 0\overrightarrow{v} = \overrightarrow{0}$ by axiom 6 and part b. Hence $(-c)\overrightarrow{v}$ also serves as an additive inverse for the vector $c\overrightarrow{v}$. By part c, therefore, we must have $(-c)\overrightarrow{v} = -(c\overrightarrow{v})$.
        \end{proof}
    \end{enumerate}

    \begin{proof}
        WTS $W$ is a subspace of $\mathbb{F}^3$. 
        
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Show that $W$ is non-empty. 

            $\begin{bmatrix} 0\\0\\0 \end{bmatrix} \in W$, so $W$ is non-empty. 

            \item Show that $W \subseteq \mathbb{F}^3$. 
            
            Since $\forall \overrightarrow{v} \in W$, $\overrightarrow{v} \in \mathbb{F}^3$, we have $W \subseteq \mathbb{F}^3$. 
            
            \item Show that $W$ is closed under vector addition. 

            Let $\overrightarrow{w_1} = \begin{bmatrix}a_1\\a_2\\a_3\end{bmatrix}, \overrightarrow{w_2} = \begin{bmatrix}b_1\\b_2\\b_3\end{bmatrix} \in W$, $a_i,b_i \in \mathbb{F}$. 
            
            Then, $\overrightarrow{w_1} + \overrightarrow{w_2} = \begin{bmatrix}a_1+b_1\\a_2+b_2\\a_3+b_3\end{bmatrix}$. 
            
            Note that $(a_1+b_1) + (a_2+b_2) + (a_3+b_3) = (a_1+a_2+a_3) + (b_1+b_2+b_3) = \underset{\mathbb{F}}{0}+\underset{\mathbb{F}}{0}=\underset{\mathbb{F}}{0}$. 
            
            Thus, $\overrightarrow{w_1} + \overrightarrow{w_2} \in W$. 
            
            That is, $W$ is closed under vector addition.

            \item Show that $W$ is closed under scalar multiplication. 
            
            Pick $r \in \mathbb{F}$, pick $\overrightarrow{w} \in W$. 
            
            $r\overrightarrow{w} = r\begin{bmatrix}a_1\\a_2\\a_3\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}ra_1\\ra_2\\ra_3\end{bmatrix}$. 
            
            $ra_1+ra_2+ra_3 = r(a_1+a_2+a_3) = r(\underset{\mathbb{F}}{0}) = \underset{\mathbb{F}}{0}$.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Show $\mathrm{Span}(S) \subseteq V$. 
        
        Pick $\overrightarrow{v} \in \mathrm{Span}\left( S \right) = \{ a_1\overrightarrow{v_1} + \dots + a_m\overrightarrow{v_m} ~|~ a_i \in \mathbb{F}, \overrightarrow{v_i} \in S, m \in \mathbb{N} \}$. 
        
        Then, $\overrightarrow{v} = a_1\overrightarrow{v_1} + \dots + a_m\overrightarrow{v_m}$ for some $\overrightarrow{v}_1, \dots, \overrightarrow{v_m} \in S$ and $a_1,\dots a_m  \in \mathbb{F}$. 
        
        Since $\overrightarrow{v_i} \in S \subseteq V$, $\overrightarrow{v}$ is a linear combination of vectors in $V$, and $V$ is a vector space. 
        
        Thus, $\overrightarrow{v} \in V$. 
        
        \item Show $\mathrm{Span}(S) \neq \emptyset$

        \item Show $\mathrm{Span}(S)$ is closed under vector addition. 

        \item Show $\mathrm{Span}(S)$ is closed under scalar multiplication.

        i.e $\overrightarrow{v} - r_1\overrightarrow{s_1} - \dots - r_m\overrightarrow{s_m} = \overrightarrow{0}$. This is a non-trivial relation among vectors in $S \cup \{ \overrightarrow{v} \}$, $S \cup \{ \overrightarrow{v} \}$ is linearly dependent. 

        Contradiction with the assumption.

        There exists a dependency relation among vectors in $S \cup \{\overrightarrow{v} \}$. 
        
        This relation should contain $\overrightarrow{v}$.

\begin{proof}
    WTS $T : V \to W$ is a linear transformation if and only if for all $a_1, \dots a_k \in \mathbb{F}$ and for all $\overrightarrow{v_1}, \dots, \overrightarrow{v_k} \in V$, $\displaystyle T(\sum_{i=1}^ka_i\overrightarrow{v_i})=\sum_{i=1}^ka_iT(\overrightarrow{v_i})$. 
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\rightarrow$: WTS $T : V \to W$ is a linear transformation $\implies \displaystyle T(\sum_{i=1}^ka_i\overrightarrow{v_i})=\sum_{i=1}^ka_iT(\overrightarrow{v_i})$. 

        Prove by induction. 
        
        \begin{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{Base case:} WTS $T(a_1\overrightarrow{v}_1)=a_1T(\overrightarrow{v_1})$
        
        This follows immediately from (2) of the definition of linear transformation. 
        
        {~~~}
        
        \item \textbf{Induction hypothesis:} $\displaystyle T(\sum_{i=1}^ka_i\overrightarrow{v_1}) = \sum_{i=1}^ka_iT(\overrightarrow{v_i})$. 
        
        WTS $\displaystyle T(\sum_{i=1}^{k+1}a_i\overrightarrow{v_1}) = \sum_{i=1}^{k+1}a_iT(\overrightarrow{v_i})$. 
        
        {~~~}
        
        By (1) of the definition of linear transformation, $\displaystyle T(\sum_{i=1}^{k+1}a_i\overrightarrow{v_i}) = T(\sum_{i=1}^{k}a_i\overrightarrow{v_i})+T(a_{k+1}\overrightarrow{v}_{k+1})$. 
        
        $\displaystyle T(\sum_{i=1}^{k}a_i\overrightarrow{v_i}) = \sum_{i=1}^ka_iT(\overrightarrow{v_i})$ by the induction hypothesis. 
        
        $T(a_{k+1}\overrightarrow{v}_{k+1}) = a_{k+1}T(\overrightarrow{v}_{k+1})$ by (2) of the definition of linear transformation. 
        \begin{flalign*}
            \text{So }
            T(\sum_{i=1}^{k+1}a_i\overrightarrow{v_i}) 
            &= T(\sum_{i=1}^{k}a_i\overrightarrow{v_i})+T(a_{k+1}\overrightarrow{v}_{k+1})
            \\&=\sum_{i=1}^ka_iT(\overrightarrow{v_i}) + a_{k+1}T(\overrightarrow{v}_{k+1})
            &&\\
            &=\sum_{i=1}^ka_iT(\overrightarrow{v_i})
        \end{flalign*}

        Thus, $\displaystyle T(\sum_{i=1}^ka_i\overrightarrow{v_i})=\sum_{i=1}^ka_iT(\overrightarrow{v_i})$.

        \item $\leftarrow$: WTS $\displaystyle T(\sum_{i=1}^ka_i\overrightarrow{v_i})=\sum_{i=1}^ka_iT(\overrightarrow{v_i}) \implies T: V \to W$ is a linear transformation.

    Let $T$ be a linear transformation. $T$ is injective if and only if $\ker T = \{ \overrightarrow{0} \}$. 
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
    WTS $T$ is injective iff $\ker T = \{\overrightarrow{0} \}$.
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\rightarrow$: Assume $T$ is injective. WTS $\ker T = \{\overrightarrow{0} \}$. 
        
        Pick $\overrightarrow{v} \in T$. 
        
        Suppose $T(\overrightarrow{v})=\overrightarrow{0_W}$. 
        
        {~~~}

        Then, $T(\overrightarrow{v}) = \overrightarrow{0_W} = T(\overrightarrow{0})$. 
        
        Since $T$ is injective, $\overrightarrow{v} = 0$. 
        
        {~~~}

        Thus, $\forall \overrightarrow{v} \in \ker T, \overrightarrow{v} = \overrightarrow{0}$.
        
        That is, $\ker T=\overrightarrow{0}$. 
        
        \item $\leftarrow$: Assume $\ker T = \{\overrightarrow{0} \}$. WTS $T$ is injective. 
        
        WTS $T(\overrightarrow{v_1}) = T(\overrightarrow{v_2}) \implies \overrightarrow{v_1} = \overrightarrow{v_2}$. 

        Pick $\overrightarrow{v_1}, \overrightarrow{v_2} \in V$. 
        
        Suppose $T(\overrightarrow{v_1})=T(\overrightarrow{v_2})$. 

        {~~~}

        Then, $T(\overrightarrow{v_1} - \overrightarrow{v_2}) = \overrightarrow{0_W}$. 
        
        By linearity of $T$, $\overrightarrow{0_W} = T(\overrightarrow{v_1} - \overrightarrow{v_2}) = T(\overrightarrow{v_1}) - T(\overrightarrow{v_2})$. 
        
        {~~~}

        Then, $\overrightarrow{v_1} - \overrightarrow{v_2} \in \ker T = \{ \overrightarrow{0_V} \}$. 
        
        Thus, $\overrightarrow{v_1} - \overrightarrow{v_2} = 0$. 
        
        That is, $\overrightarrow{v_1} = \overrightarrow{v_2}$.

    Thus, $T$ is injective iff $\ker T = \{\overrightarrow{0} \}$.

    We will use subspace test.

        The follows immediately form the definition of kernel.

        Since $T(\overrightarrow{0})=\overrightarrow{0}$, $\overrightarrow{0} \in \ker T$. So $\ker T \neq \emptyset$.

        Pick $\overrightarrow{v_1}, \overrightarrow{v_2} \in \ker T$.

            &\text{since }\overrightarrow{v_1}, \overrightarrow{v_2} \in \ker T
            \\
            &=\overrightarrow{0_W}
        \end{align*}

        \item Show that $\ker T$ is closed under scalar multiplication. 
        
        Pick $\overrightarrow{v} \in V$, $r \in \mathbb{F}$. 
        \begin{align*}
            T(r\overrightarrow{v})
            &=rT(\overrightarrow{v}))

    If $V$ is a \bred{finite-dimensional} vector space and $T: V \to W$ is a linear transformation, then $$\dim V = \dim \mathrm{img}~T + \dim \ker T$$
\end{theorem}
\setcounter{section}{2}

\begin{proof}
    Proof: WTS $\dim V = \dim \mathrm{img}~T + \dim \ker T$. 

    {~~~}
    
    Consider a basis $\overrightarrow{u_1}, \dots, \overrightarrow{u_m}$ for $\ker T$. 
    
    $\overrightarrow{u_1}, \dots, \overrightarrow{u_m}$ is linearly independent in $V$, thus it can be extended to a basis for $V$. 
    
    Suppose $\overrightarrow{u_1}, \dots, \overrightarrow{u_m}, \overrightarrow{v_1}, \dots, \overrightarrow{v_n}$ is a basis for $V$ we get. 

    Note that $\dim \ker T = m$, and $\dim V = m + n$. 
    
    {~~~}

    WTS $\dim \mathrm{img}~T = n$. 
    
    Take $\overrightarrow{w} \in \mathrm{img}~T$. 
    
    Then, $\exists \overrightarrow{v} \in V$ s.t. $T(\overrightarrow{v}) = \overrightarrow{w}$. 
    \begin{align*}  
        \overrightarrow{w}
        &=T(\overrightarrow{v})
        \\
        &= T(a_1\overrightarrow{u_1} + \dots + a_m\overrightarrow{u_m} + b_1\overrightarrow{v_1} + \dots + b_n\overrightarrow{v_n})
        \text{ for some }a_i, b_i \in \mathbb{F}
        \\
        &= a_1T(\overrightarrow{u_1}) + \dots + a_mT(\overrightarrow{u_m}) + b_1T(\overrightarrow{v_1}) + \dots + b_nT(\overrightarrow{v_n})
    \end{align*}
    
    {~~~}

    Since $\overrightarrow{v_1}, \dots, \overrightarrow{v_n}$ is a basis for $\ker T$, $a_iT(\overrightarrow{u_i}) = \overrightarrow{0}$. 
    $$\overrightarrow{w} = b_1T(\overrightarrow{v_1}) + \dots + b_nT(\overrightarrow{v_n})$$

    {~~~}

    Thus, $\mathrm{img}~T = \mathrm{Span}\left( T(\overrightarrow{v_1}), \dots, T(\overrightarrow{v_n}) \right)$. 

    {~~~}

    Show that $T(\overrightarrow{v_1}), \dots, T(\overrightarrow{v_n})$ is linearly independent. 
    
    $c_1 T(\overrightarrow{v_1}), \dots, c_nT(\overrightarrow{v_n}) = \overrightarrow{0}$, WTS $c_i = 0$.

        T ( \underbrace{c_1\overrightarrow{v_1}, \dots, c_n\overrightarrow{v_n}}_{\in~\ker T} ) 
        &= \overrightarrow{0}
        \\
        c_1\overrightarrow{v_1} + \dots + c_n\overrightarrow{v_n} 
        &= r_1\overrightarrow{u_1} + \dots + r_m\overrightarrow{u}_m \text{ for some } r_i \in \mathbb{F}
        \\
        c_1\overrightarrow{v_1} + \dots + c_n\overrightarrow{v_n} - r_1\overrightarrow{u_1} - \dots - r_m\overrightarrow{u}_m 
        &= \overrightarrow{0}

    {~~~}

    $\{\overrightarrow{v_i}, \overrightarrow{u_j} ~|~  i \le u \le m, 1 \le j \le n \}$ is a basis for $V$. 
    
    Thus, $c_1 = \dots = c_n = r_1 = \dots = r_n = 0$. 
    
    So $T(\overrightarrow{v_1}), \dots, T(\overrightarrow{v_n})$ is linearly independent, and so it is a basis for $V$. 
    
    $\dim \mathrm{img}~T = n$.

\begin{definition}[Eigenvector and Eigenvalue]

    Let $V$ be a vector space over the field $\mathbb{F}$.

    Let $T: V \to V$ be a linear mapping.

    \textbf{a)} A vector $\overrightarrow{v} \in V$ is called an \term{eigenvector of $T$} if $\overrightarrow{v} \neq \overrightarrow{0}$ and there exists a scalar $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $T(\overrightarrow{v}) = \lambda \overrightarrow{v}$.

    \textbf{b)} If $\overrightarrow{v}$ is an eigenvector of $T$ and $T(\overrightarrow{v}) = \lambda\overrightarrow{v}$, the scalar $\lambda$ is called the \term{eigenvalue of $T$ corresponding to $\overrightarrow{v}$}.
\end{definition}

\setcounter{chapter}{4}
\setcounter{definitionT}{5}
\begin{definition}[Eigenspace]

    $\forall \lambda \in \mathbb{F}$, the \term{$\lambda$-eigenspace of $T$}, denoted $E_\lambda$, is the set $$E_\lambda = \{ \overrightarrow{v} \in V ~|~ T(\overrightarrow{v}) = \lambda \overrightarrow{v} \} = \{ \text{all eigenvectors of } \lambda \} \cup \{ \overrightarrow{0} \}$$

    That is, $E_k$ is the set containing all the eigenvectors of $T$ with eigenvalue $\lambda$, together with the vector $\overrightarrow{0}$. (If $\lambda$ is not an eigenvalue of $T$, then we have $E_\lambda = {\overrightarrow{0}}$.)
\end{definition}
\setcounter{chapter}{3}

\begin{example}
{~~~}

    $\begin{matrix} \text{Consider the linear transformation } D: &\mathcal{C}^\infty(\mathbb{R}) &\to &\mathcal{C}^\infty(\mathbb{R}). \\ &f &\mapsto &f' \end{matrix}$

    \begin{itemize}
        \item $1$ is a eigenvector with a eigenvalue of $0$.

        \item $e^x$ is an eigenvector is with a eigenvalue of $1$.

        \item $e^{Mx}$ is an eigenvector with the eigenvalue of $M$.
    \end{itemize}
\end{example}

\begin{example}
    Define the plane $W: x + y + z = 0$.

    $\begin{matrix} \text{Consider the linear transformation }R: &\mathbb{R}^3 &\to &\mathbb{R}^3 \\ &\overrightarrow{x} &\mapsto &\overrightarrow{x}\text{ reflected w.r.t. }W \end{matrix}$

    $\forall \overrightarrow{x} \in W,~R(\overrightarrow{v}) = 1\overrightarrow{v}$, so $\lambda = 1$ is an eigenvalue, and $E_1 = W$.

    $R(\overrightarrow{w}) = -\overrightarrow{w}$ for all $\overrightarrow{w} \perp W$, so $\lambda = -1$ is an eigenvalue, and $E_{-1} = \mathrm{Sp}(\overrightarrow{w})$.
\end{example}


\setcounter{chapter}{4}
\setcounter{dummy}{6}
\begin{proposition}
$E_\lambda$ is a subspace of $V$ for all $\lambda$.
\end{proposition}
\setcounter{chapter}{3}

\begin{proof}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $T(\overrightarrow{0}) = \overrightarrow{0} = \lambda\overrightarrow{0} \implies \overrightarrow{x} \in E_\lambda$

        \item Pick $\overrightarrow{v}, \overrightarrow{w} \in E_\lambda$.

        WTS $\overrightarrow{v} + \overrightarrow{w} \in E_\lambda$.

        $T(\overrightarrow{v} + \overrightarrow{w}) = T(\overrightarrow{v}) + T(\overrightarrow{w}) = \lambda\overrightarrow{v} + \lambda \overrightarrow{w} = \lambda(\overrightarrow{v} + \overrightarrow{w}) \in E_\lambda$

        \item Pick $\overrightarrow{v} \in E_\lambda$, $r \in \mathbb{F}$.

        WTS $T(r\overrightarrow{v}) = rT(\overrightarrow{v})$.

        $T(r\overrightarrow{v}) = \lambda(r\overrightarrow{v}) = r(\lambda\overrightarrow{x}) = rT(\overrightarrow{v}) \in E_\lambda$.
    \end{itemize}
\end{proof}

\subsubsection{Eigenbasis}

Consider the same linear transformation $R$ discussed in example 2.

$R(\overrightarrow{x}) = A\overrightarrow{x}$

$A=[R]_\mathcal{E} = \begin{bmatrix} | &| &| \\ R(\overrightarrow{e_1}) &R(\overrightarrow{e_2}) &R(\overrightarrow{e_3}) \\ | &| &| \end{bmatrix} = \frac{1}{3}\begin{bmatrix} 1 &-2 &-2 \\ -2 &1 &-2 \\ -2 &-2 &1 \end{bmatrix}$

Eigenbasis: linearly independent and spans $\mathbb{R}^3$.

For example: $\mathcal{B} = \left\{
\underbrace{ \begin{pmatrix} 1\\1\\-2 \end{pmatrix} }_{\overrightarrow{v_1}},
\underbrace{ \begin{pmatrix} 2\\1\\-2 \end{pmatrix} }_{\overrightarrow{v_2}},
\underbrace{ \begin{pmatrix} 1\\1\\1 \end{pmatrix} }_{\overrightarrow{w}}
\right\}$

Then, $[R]_\mathcal{B} =
\begin{bmatrix} | &| &| \\ [R(\overrightarrow{v_1})]_\mathcal{B} &[R(\overrightarrow{v_2})]_\mathcal{B} &[R(\overrightarrow{w})]_\mathcal{B} \\ | &| &| \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 &0 &0 \\ 0 &1 &0 \\ 0 &0 &-1 \end{bmatrix}$

$[R(\overrightarrow{v_1})]_\mathcal{B} = [\overrightarrow{v_1}]_\mathcal{B} = \begin{bmatrix} 1\\0\\0 \end{bmatrix}$

$[R(\overrightarrow{v_2})]_\mathcal{B} = [\overrightarrow{v_2}]_\mathcal{B}=\begin{bmatrix} 0\\1\\0 \end{bmatrix}$

$[R(\overrightarrow{w})]_\mathcal{B} = [\overrightarrow{w}]_\mathcal{B}=\begin{bmatrix} 0\\0\\-1 \end{bmatrix}$

Let $T: V \to V$ be a linear transformation.

$\overrightarrow{v} \in V$  is an eigenvector if and only if $T(\overrightarrow{v}) = \lambda \overrightarrow{v}$, by the definition.
\begin{align*}
    T(\overrightarrow{v}) - \lambda \overrightarrow{v}
    &= \overrightarrow{0}
    \\
    T(\overrightarrow{v}) - \lambda ~ id(\overrightarrow{v})
    &= \overrightarrow{0}
    \\
    (T-\lambda ~ id)\overrightarrow{v}
    &= 0
    &\text{by sum of linear transformations}
    \\
    \overrightarrow{v} &\in \ker (T - \lambda ~ \mathrm{id}) &\text{for some }\lambda \in \mathbb{F}
\end{align*}

\setcounter{chapter}{4}
\setcounter{dummy}{4}
\begin{proposition}
    A vector $\overrightarrow{v}$ is an eigenvector of $T$ with eigenvalue $\lambda$ if and only if $\overrightarrow{v} \neq \overrightarrow{0}$ and $\overrightarrow{v} \in \ker(T - \lambda \mathrm{id})$.
\end{proposition}
\setcounter{chapter}{3}


\begin{example}
{~~~}

    Let $\dim V = n$, and fix a basis $\mathcal{B}$ for $V$. 

    $\begin{matrix} \text{Then, } \mathcal{L}(V, V) &\overset{\cong}{\to} &\underset{n \times n}M(\mathbb{F}) \\ T &\mapsto &[T]_\mathcal{B} = B \end{matrix}$

    Suppose $\overrightarrow{v}$ is an eigenvector of $T$.

    $T(\overrightarrow{v}) - \lambda \overrightarrow{v}$ means that $[T]_\mathcal{B}[\overrightarrow{v}]_\mathcal{B} = [\lambda\overrightarrow{v}]_\mathcal{B} = \lambda [\overrightarrow{v}]_\mathcal{B}$.
    \begin{align*}
        [T - \lambda ~ id]_\mathcal{B}
        &= [T]_\mathcal{B} - \lambda[id]_\mathcal{B}
        \\
        &={B - \lambda I}_{n \times n}
    \end{align*}

    $\lambda$ is an eigenvalue for $T$ iff $B - \lambda I$ is not invertible.

    $\lambda$ is an eigenvalue for $T$ iff $\det (B - \lambda I) = 0$.

    This is called that \bred{characteristic polynomial} of the linear transformation $T$.
\end{example}

\setcounter{chapter}{4}
\setcounter{definitionT}{10}
\begin{definition}[Characteristic Polynomial]
    Let $A \in M_{n \times n}(\mathbb{R})$. The polynomial $\det(A = \lambda I)$ is called the \term{characteristic polynomial} of $A$.
\end{definition}
\setcounter{chapter}{3}

\begin{example}
    {~~~}

    $\begin{matrix} T: &\mathcal{P}_3(\mathbb{R}) &\to &P_3(\mathbb{R}) \\ &p &\mapsto &p' + 2p \end{matrix}$

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Find the characteristic polynomial of $T$.

        Pick the basis $\mathcal{B} = ( 1, x, x^2, x^3 )$. Then, $B = \begin{bmatrix} 2 &1 &0 &0 \\ 0 &2 &2 &0 \\ 0 &0 &2 &3 \\\ 0 &0 &0 &2 \end{bmatrix}$.

        $$\mathrm{char}(T) = \det(B -\lambda I) = (\lambda-2)^4{~~~}\footnote{Note that the power of $4$ means the \term{algebraic multiplicity} of $\lambda = 2$ is $4$.}$$

        \bred{Note:} $\mathrm{char}(T)$ is well defined (does NOT depend on the choice of basis).

        \item Find all eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenspace of $T$.

        $$E_2 = \mathrm{nul}(B - \lambda I) = \mathrm{sp}\begin{pmatrix} 1\\0\\0\\0 \end{pmatrix}$$

        $\dim(E_2) = 1$ is the \term{geometric multiplicity} of $\lambda = 2$.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{example}

\section{Diagonalizability}

\setcounter{chapter}{4}
\begin{definition}[Diagonalizable]
    Let $V$ be a finite-dimensional vector space, and let $T: V \to V$ be a linear mapping. $T$ is said to be \term{diagonalizable} if there exists a basis of $V$, all of whose vectors are eigenvectors of $T$.
\end{definition}

\setcounter{dummy}{1}
\begin{proposition}
    $T: V \to V$ is diagonalizable if and only if, for any basis $\alpha$ of $V$, the matrix $[T]_\alpha^\alpha$ is similar to a diagonal matrix.
\end{proposition}
\setcounter{chapter}{3}

\begin{proof}
{~~~}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\rightarrow$: WTS $T$ is diagonalizable $\implies \exists$ a basis  of $\mathcal{B}$ s.t.  is diagonal.
         
        $T$ has an eigenbasis $\mathcal{B} = (\overrightarrow{b_1}, \dots, \overrightarrow{b_n})$. 
    
        Note that $T(\overrightarrow{b_i}) = \lambda_i \overrightarrow{b_i}$ for some $\lambda_i \in \mathbb{F}$. 
        
        $[T]_\mathcal{B} = \begin{bmatrix} | & &| \\ [T(\overrightarrow{b_1})]_\mathcal{B} &\dots &[T(\overrightarrow{b_n})]_\mathcal{B} \\ | & &| \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} | & &| \\ [\lambda_1\overrightarrow{b_1}]_\mathcal{B} &\dots &[\lambda_n\overrightarrow{b_n}]_\mathcal{B} \\ | & &| \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \lambda_1 &0 &\cdots &0 \\ 0 &\lambda_2 & &\vdots \\ \vdots &\vdots & &0 \\ 0 &0 &\cdots &\lambda_n  \end{bmatrix}$

        \item $\leftarrow$: WTS $\exists$ a basis $\mathcal{B}$ of $T$ s.t. $[T]_\mathcal{B}$ is diagonal $\implies T$ is diagonalizable.
        
        $\exists$ a basis $\mathcal{B} = (\overrightarrow{b_1}, \dots, \overrightarrow{b_n})$ s.t. $[T]_\mathcal{B} = \begin{bmatrix} a_1 &0 &\cdots &0 \\ 0 &a_1 &\cdots &0 \\ \vdots &\vdots &\ddots &\vdots \\ 0 &0 &\cdots &a_n \end{bmatrix}$. 

        $[T]_\mathcal{B} = \begin{bmatrix} | & &| \\ [T(\overrightarrow{b_1})]_\mathcal{B} &\dots &[T(\overrightarrow{b_n})]_\mathcal{B} \\ | & &| \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} a_1 &0 &\cdots &0 \\ 0 &a_1 &\cdots &0 \\ \vdots &\vdots &\ddots &\vdots \\ 0 &0 &\cdots &a_n \end{bmatrix}$
        \begin{flalign*}
            \forall i, [T(\overrightarrow{b_i})]_\mathcal{B} 
            &= a_i\overrightarrow{e_i}
            &&\\
            [a_i\overrightarrow{b_i}]_\mathcal{B} 
            &= a_i\overrightarrow{e_i}
        \end{flalign*}

        So $T(\overrightarrow{b_i}) = a_i\overrightarrow{b_i}$, since $\gamma_\mathcal{B}$ is injective.

\end{proposition}
\setcounter{chapter}{3}

\begin{proof}
    We know that $T(\overrightarrow{v_i}) = \lambda_i\overrightarrow{v_i}$, $1 \le i \le k$ and $\lambda_i \neq \lambda_j$ for $i \neq j$. 

    WTS $\{ \overrightarrow{v_1}, \dots, \overrightarrow{v_k} \}$ is linearly independent.

\end{quote}

    Induction on $k$
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Base case:} $k = 1$

        $0 \neq \overrightarrow{v_1}$ is linearly independent.
        
        \item \textbf{Induction hypothesis:} suppose $\overrightarrow{v_1}, \dots, \overrightarrow{v_k}$ is linearly independent. 
    
        Prove that $\overrightarrow{v_1}, \dots, \overrightarrow{v_k}, \overrightarrow{v_{k+1}}$ is linearly independent. 

    Suppose $a_1\overrightarrow{v_1} + a_2\overrightarrow{v_2} + \dots + a_k\overrightarrow{v_k} + a_{k+1}\overrightarrow{v_k}_{k+1} = \overrightarrow{0}$. (*)

    WTS $a_1 = \dots = a_k = a_{k+1} = 0$. 

    Apply $T$ to (*): 
    \begin{align*}
        a_1T(\overrightarrow{v_1}) + a_kT(\overrightarrow{v_k}) +a_{k+1}T(\overrightarrow{v_{k+1}}) 
        &= \overrightarrow{0}

        \label{eq:1}\tag{1}
    \end{align*}

    Multiply (*) by $\lambda_{k+1}$ (if $\lambda_{k_i} = 0$, switch with $\lambda_k$): 
    \begin{equation*}
        a_1\lambda_{k+1}\overrightarrow{v_1} + \dots + a_k\lambda_{k+1}\overrightarrow{v_k} + a_{k+1}\lambda_{k+1}\overrightarrow{v}_{k+1}
        \label{eq:2}\tag{2}

    $\ref{eq:1} - \ref{eq:2}$: 
    $a_1(\lambda_1 - \lambda_{k+1})\overrightarrow{v_1} + \dots + a_k(\lambda_k-\lambda_{k+1})\overrightarrow{v}_k = \overrightarrow{0}$

    We have $a_1 = \dots = a_k = 0$. 
    
    {~~~}

    Plug back into (*): 

    $a_{k+1} = 0$. So $\overrightarrow{v_1}, \dots, \overrightarrow{v}_{k+1}$ are linearly independent.

    \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
        \item For all $\vec{x}, \vec{y}, \vec{z} \in \mathbb{R}^n$ and all $c \in \mathbb{R}$, $\langle c\vec{x} + \vec{y}, \vec{z} \rangle = c \langle \vec{x}, \vec{z} \rangle + \langle \vec{y}, \vec{z} \rangle$. (In other words, as a function of the first variable, the inner product is a \itblue{linear} mapping.)
        \item For all $\vec{x}, \vec{y} \in \mathbb{R}^n$, $\langle \vec{x}, \vec{y} \rangle = \langle \vec{y}, \vec{x} \rangle$ (i.e., the inner product is ``\itblue{symmetric}'').
        \item For all $\vec{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n$, $\langle \vec{x}, \vec{x} \rangle \ge 0$, and $\langle \vec{x}, \vec{x} \rangle = 0$ if and only if $\vec{x} = \vec{0}$. (We say the standard inner product is ``\itblue{positive-definite}''.)
    \end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}
\setcounter{chapter}{3}

\begin{proof}
    Many of the simpler facts about the standard inner product may be derived by expanding out the expressions involved, using \hyperref[Def4_3_1]{Definition (4.3.1)}.
    
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
        \item Write $\vec{x} = (x_1, \dots, x_n)$, $\vec{y} = (y_1, \dots, y_n)$, and $\vec{z} = (z_1, \dots, z_n)$. Then $\langle c\vec{x} + \vec{y} \rangle = (cx_1 + y_1, \dots, x_n + y_n)$, so we have $$\langle \vec{x} + \vec{y}, \vec{z} \rangle = (cx_1 + y_1)z_1 + \dots + (cx_n + y_n)z_n$$ After multiplying this out and rearranging the terms, we obtain $$\langle \vec{x} + \vec{y}, \vec{z} \rangle = c(x_1z_1 + \dots + x_nz_n)+ \cdots + (y_1z_1+ \cdots + y_nz_n) = c \langle \vec{x}, \vec{z} \rangle + \langle \vec{y}, \vec{z} \rangle$$ 

        \item We have:
        \vspace{-0.45cm} 
        \begin{align*}
            \langle \vec{x}, \vec{y} \rangle 
            &= x_1y_1 + \cdots + x_ny_n 
            \\
            &= y_1x_1 + \cdots + y_nz_n
            \\
            &= \langle \vec{y}, \vec{x} \rangle.
        \end{align*}
        
        \item By the definition, $\langle \vec{x}, \vec{x} \rangle = x_1^2 + \cdots + x_n^2$. Since the components of $\vec{x}$ are all real numbers, each $x_i^2 \ge 0$, so $\langle \vec{x}, \vec{x} \rangle \ge 0$. Furthermore, if $\langle \vec{x}, \vec{x} \rangle = 0$, then it is clear that $x_i = 0$ for all $i$, or in other words, that $\vec{x} = \vec{0}$.
    \end{enumerate}

        &= r_1\langle \overrightarrow{u_1}, \overrightarrow{u_1} \rangle + r_2 \langle \overrightarrow{u_2}, \overrightarrow{u_1} \rangle
        \\
        &= r_1 \cdot 1 + r_2 \cdot 0
        \\
        &= r_1
    \end{align*}
